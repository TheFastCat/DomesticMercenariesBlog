This is the first in a three part series on journaling. See also part 2 [5 Steps for Starting to Journal](/posts/5-Steps-for-Starting-to-Journal/) and part 3 "Inspiring Products to Jump Start Your Journaling".

Keeping a journal (aka agenda, diary, planner) has become a popular trend for time management, tracking goals and even measuring health and wellness. Journals may also serve as to-do lists, calendars, note compendiums, sketch books and organizational systems across your life. Journaling can help to map goals, thoughts and feelings, spur creativity, mindfulness and health. So if you are interested in starting to journal or if you are looking for ideas to improve how you journal -- read on!

### See the Forest Through The Trees
Use a journal as a traditional calendar and day planner. By recording the events that you spend time on you can visualize how time is spent each day, week, month and year. By plotting regular actions we can recognize the patterns that shape our life. Planning activity and recording results allows us to quantify the effects. Are we getting enough exercise, feeding ourselves the foods we need to perform the best, getting adequate sleep? When are we feeling our best and worst? Is there time to add more of what we need to flourish? Can we subtract obligations that aren't serving our goals?

### Stop living for the weekend
It can be easy to get into a rut with the routine of work, to-dos and obligations. If the five day work week feels a repetitive chore until the arrival of a weekend then something should change; no one wants to live life two days a week! Once we have power over our scheduling, we can optimize it to accommodate happy habits throughout the week. All-of-a-sudden our Wednesday noon yoga class and evening happy hour is something we are looking forward to on Sunday!

### Foster Healthy Habits
A journal is the perfect device for encouraging continual growth and improvement. By focusing on a new skill, hobby or interest and actively prioritizing it through regular scheduling and practice you can grow new habits. Plan a new habit and regularly prioritize it in your schedule. For instance, if you made time to read, meditate or exercise an additional 15 minutes per day, how much could you achieve throughout the course of the year? 

### Program Your Behavior
We can manifest positive action by prioritization via scheduling and action. Writing down a grocery list of healthy foods is a plan to cook and eat them. This opens the door for learning new culinary skills as well. The journal becomes a contract we agree to with ourselves. When we stick to the plans that we make we enact the positive change we strive for. We enact the power to control our actions simply by defining our desires!

### Catalog Ups and Downs
We all have periods of low energy, enthusiasm or motivation. Cataloging these periods along with what helped break out of them in the context of everything else going on in our life gives insight into why they happen. Perhaps it's the stress of a loaded calendar, not enough time for recreation, or perhaps poor diet, exercise or sleep quality. Keeping a visual record of wins and losses in your journal will help understand when they happened and also to glean why; in the future we can optimize to account for them in order to perform at our best.

### Experimentation and Change
Changing up a routine is a great way to energize creativity and create excitement. A journal is the perfect place to safely plan for and try new things. It can be new habits, hobbies even cooking recipes or activities. You can introduce change into your routines in a comfortable manner by planning future travel, events or even hosting or attending social activities. Regularly schedule and prioritize a new event or activity each week or month to challenge your standard modus operandi. Record victories and challenges and continue to experiment in order to discover where you thrive.

### Inexpensive and Simple
For the cost of a spiraled notebook and a few minutes of time, you can record your actions, plan your goals and evaluate your progress. For such an archaic medium by today's technological standards - paper and pen can be powerful! When you factor in the return on investment (in yourself!) a case could be made that actively prioritizing self-success through the purchase of a journal is the best $5 you can spend.

### 100% You
Journals are a terrific medium for self expression because they are personal to you and as such infinitely individualized to you. A journal can include creative writing, diaries, notes, drawings, poems, photos, ideas. With some effort you have a day planner that also serves as a personal-creative outlet for reflection, measurement and inspiration. A journal will challenge you to be a better version of yourself by highlighting your victories and encouraging more of them.

In the next installment of this three-part series we discuss specifics in how to create a journal to work best for you.
