This is part two in a three part series on journaling. In this post we systemize the process of starting to keep a journal. Afterwards you will be prepared to focus your actions to achieve goals and realize improvement in your life. See also part 1 "8 Reasons to Keep a Journal" and part 3 "Inspiring Products to Jump Start Your Journaling".

### Step One: Plan
Start by outlining in your journal the events in your daily, weekly and monthly life. These can include bill due dates, soccer practice, public holidays, family birthdays, doctor appointments, spring cleaning. This scheduling calendar will serve as the initial body of content for your journal so don't overthink it or 
worry if it ends up a little sparse!

***

*Do*: Add reminders for tasks that would otherwise go unscheduled or are easily forgotten. Should I replace my air filters this month? Does my car need an oil change? Should I repair that fence?

*Avoid*: repeating yourself. If you already use a calendar, both systems can eventually merge for the sake of simplicity (if that helps), but for now discover inherent benefits in segregating both.

*Remember*: your journal will grown into more than a calendar and scheduler!

### Step2: Optimize
After scheduling these to-dos, obligations and "shoulds," immediate opportunity can be discerned. Re-evaluate what you have already written and think critically about what is present and also missing. Often there is room for optimization:

* "I have a spare two hours on Tuesday so I can go to yoga before dinner instead of wasting that time staring at my phone."
* "If I stop by the grocery store on the way to my dentist appointment, then I don't need to go on Saturday. That saves gasoline and time."
* "If I invite Vince to the movie with Sylvia and I on Friday, then that frees up Saturday afternoon and it would be more fun with three of us!"
* "I want to go for a run before Wednesday's morning meeting"

and sometimes you can perceive opportunity to do less... :
* "I've got a busy week next week - I'd rather cancel Sunday evening so I can catch up on sleep."
* "Why am I even paying this bill? I never even watch cable TV - I should cancel it."

***

*Do*: Utilize the 80/20 rule --  most of the value of this exercise come from just a small part of it!

*Avoid*: Over planning. Grant yourself wiggle room for things that inevitably come up.

*Remember*: You are the master of your time! Take control of it to realize improvements.

### Step 3: Recognize
A journal is an effective tool for accomplishing goals and realizing desires; however, the process of discovering what we want can often be harder than achieving it.What do you want? Is it more time? More money? A new job? A vacation? Do you want to learn a new language, skill or hobby? If you struggle to define what you want this exercise can help.You can become more mindful of emotions and desires by reflecting on them. Here are some starting points to help:

* Do I have a need that isn't being met?
* What am I grateful for?
* Is something in my life affecting my happiness?
* What can I improve that would make a difference?
* Is there something I used to enjoy doing that I no longer do?
* Is there something I want to start doing?
* How can I help myself be happier?

Answers might be:
* "I want to help others more"
* "I want to lose weight"
* "I want to read more books"
* "I want to be less stressed out"
* "I want more friends"
  
Once you have defined what you want you have already done a lot of the work!

***

*Do*: Continually practice recognition of desires and gratitude.

*Avoid*: Ignoring your desires and needs.

*Remember*: The main value of the exercise will come from continual reflection.

### Step 4: Strategize
After you recognize opportunities for improvement and growth, manifest them into actions. Create one or more actionable goals for the coming week and month.    "I want to volunteer in my local community"    "I want to join a book club to read more books and meet new people"    "I want to walk for three hours each week to help me relax and get exercise"    "I want to join a poker club to have a new hobby"

***

*Do*: Transform your desire into action.

*Avoid*: Day-dreaming. Instead focus on how you can create and achieve what you desire.

*Remember*: This is a challenging step for many people. Like all sorts of exercise, you will improve the more you do it.

### Step 5: Focus
Here is where the magic happens. After recognizing desires and creating actionable goals to accomplish them, schedule necessary steps into your journal.

* *"I want to help others more"*  => "I'll volunteer each Tuesday evening at the local library"

* *"I want to lose weight"* => "I'll go to the gym three times a week before work, and walk more"

* *"I want to read more books"* => "I found a bookclub online, the next meeting is next week"

* *"I want to be less stressed out"* => "I'll add 20 minutes of meditation to my morning routine"

***

*Do*: Start simple and prioritize consistency. 

*Avoid*: Indeterminate goals that can't be tracked such as "Get better at drawing" instead try something more actionable like "draw for three hours"

*Remember*: Goals are promises to yourself.

### Conclusion
If you complete this system when starting a new journal be prepared for a motivational jump start. Afterwards you will have a steady stream of ideas and inspiration for your journal content.
