<a href="https://domesticMercenaries.com/" target="_blank">Domestic Mercenaries</a> frees your time from household upkeep by facilitating easy home-services for a flat rate of $25/hour. Here are five ways we simplify your to-do list:

### Ã  la Carte Services Tailored to Your Needs
We offer a variety of home services including home cleaning, home-cooking, laundry and grocery shopping. Bundle these services together for extra convenience and simplicity or mix and match as you need them!

### Simple Online Scheduling
Our online booking alleviates the back-and-forth of service scheduling. There is no need to download an app, remember a password or even call to book services. How does it work? It's easy: 

- Navigate to <a href="https://domesticMercenaries.com/" target="_blank">domesticmercenaries.com</a>
- Select <a href="https://book.pocketsuite.io/book/domestic-mercenaries" target="_blank">"Hire"</a>
- Select a service or combination of services to be scheduled.
- Select a calendar date and time for the service.
- Enter your contact and payment information (you wont be billed until after the service is complete).
- A text will be sent to your phone confirming the appointment!

### Painless Payment
Each of our services costs $25/hour. That means just schedule the times you need and we'll fill it with the services you want. Pay electronically and easily from your mobile phone or computer with a credit card -- no need to have cash on hand. Invoicing is handled and delivered to you via text, electronically.

### Personalized Attention
We adapt our services to how you need them: which spots need extra attention while cleaning, how spicy you like your enchiladas, and what brand of beer you want stocked in your fridge. And don't worry -- we have a telephone number (833-344-HOME) if ever you want to talk things over.

### No Obligations!
